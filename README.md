# Introduction

This is a placeholder for python scripts that are meant to automate pipelines of operations. 
Currently it includes:

1. `doPandoc` - utility to process Scrivener-based mmd documents into any output format that is supported by pandoc. Is building heavily on LaTeX sources, but that is not required; you can direct Scrivener to compile to docx as well.
