# Introduction

This is a placeholder for python scripts that are meant to automate pipelines of operations. 
Currently it includes:

1. `doPandoc` - utility to process Scrivener-based mmd documents into any output format that is supported by pandoc. Is building heavily on LaTeX sources, but that is not required; you can direct Scrivener to compile to docx as well.



## doPandoc
### Installation
This is a python script, hence provide for a python-3 environment to run this in a shell. Furthermore, it supports git, hence make sure git is installed as well.

### Operation
Operate this script from a shell:

1. Open a shell, `cd` to the folder that contains your Scrivener project (i.e., contains your `myProject.scriv` folder) and run\\
1. `python doPandoc.py` \\
or make your windows environment to understand the `.py` extension and run\\
1. `doPandoc`

Without any arguments, this command will return a default `usage: ...` instruction. For more information, run `doPandoc -h`.

Using this script requires a specific structure of the source folders:

* `templates` contains all the templates that your project can make use of for its visual appearance;
    * The `templates/tex/latex` directory is where LaTeX support files go (see Fletcher Penney's [peg-multimarkdown-latex-support] (https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown-latex-support) project for a superset of what's bundled).
* `src` contains all files that are to be included in your resulting report:
    * `bib` can be used to store your bibliography if you maintain an external one. This is LaTeX oriented, hence consider a `.bib` file.
    * `docs` will contain all the `mmd` (or other) documents that are compiled by Scrivener. Note that these will be generated by Scrivener - there is no reason for you to hassle around with files in this directory. You can, however, compile different parts of your Scrivener project into distinct source documents;
        * The `preamble.mmd` file contains metadata for LaTeX.
        * The `user.mmd` file, should you provide it, contains additional metadata for your purposes.
    * `images` should contain all your images that you want to include in your end result. In contradiction to the `docs` folder, here you need to actively copy your images to.
* `results` contains the result of the production process, if you have one. Since I am using `pandoc` to take care of the actual production process, it would compile its results (mostly `.pdf` files) here; again, this is a location where results are generated into, and, hence, there is no need for you to hassle around with files in this folder;
